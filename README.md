# Hey!

What happens when you give a man tons of time? You get me.

Hello! I’m K97i. I'm primarily a music producer, but I also do programming!

My main interest is music which could be found on my YouTube channel, but you can also find my Frontend Dev work as well as my scripts here!

_K9's Dev Work:_

  1. A member of the [Spec-ify](https://github.com/Spec-ify/) dev team. I developed the GUI for specify from the design of [zleyyij](https://github.com/zleyyij/). I am also one of the maintainers of [specified](https://github.com/Spec-ify/specified).

  2. I also used to be an active member (helper :DDD) of the [r/techsupport Discord](https://rtech.support/discord). I also help out with the Wiki team with proofreading, and help develop the frontend side of Hyde, their wiki editor written in Svelte (Typescript).

  3. Created [my own site](https://www.k97i.com/), using Jekyll's Minima theme as a basis, modifying it to my own style and adding some QOL features. 

**Thanks for reading!**
